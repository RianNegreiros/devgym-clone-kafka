# Kafka Clone

A simplified implementation of a message broker system, inspired by Apache Kafka. This project was created as a challenge from [Devgym](https://www.devgym.com.br).

## Overview

The Kafka Clone project is a basic message broker system that allows clients to publish and consume messages through a TCP connection. It provides a simplified version of the publish-subscribe model, allowing clients to create topics, publish messages to topics, and consume messages from topics.
